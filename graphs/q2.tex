\textbf{Graph transposition} \\
Write pseudocode for a simple method that, given $n$ and the adjacency list representation of a directed
graph $G = (V, E)$ of $n$ vertices, returns the adjacency list representation of GT , the transpose of G,
defined by $(V, E^T )$, where $E^T = \{(u, v) |(v, u)  \in E\}$., State the time complexity. You merely have to
state the algorithm and its time complexity, and there is no need to justify correctness.

\textbf{A Different Implementation of Dijkstra's}
\begin{parts}
    \part Let $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted, directed graph with nonnegative weight function $w : E \rightarrow
    \{0, 1, 2, \ldots W \}$, for some nonnegative integer $W$. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to compute
    the shortest paths from a given source vertex s in $O(W V + E)$ time. Explain why your algorithm
    is correct and why its time complexity to be $O(WV +E)$.

                    \If{$dist[v] > dist[u] + w(u, v)$}{
                        $old\_dist \gets dist[v]$ \\
                        $dist[v] \gets dist[u] + w(u, v)$ \\
                        Insert $v$ into $buckets[dist[v]]$
                    }
                }
            }

            \Return $dist$
        }
    \end{algorithm}

    \textbf{Explanation:} The algorithm uses an array of buckets indexed by \textit{tentative distance values}. 
    Each bucket at index $i$ holds all vertices whose current shortest-path estimate is $i$. This structure ensures 
    that vertices are processed in non-decreasing order of distanceâ€”just like in Dijkstra's algorithm with priority queue. \\

    Since all edge weights are integers in $\{0, 1, \ldots, W\}$, the maximum possible shortest-path distance from the source to any vertex is at most $W \cdot |V|$. Therefore, we only need $W \cdot |V|$ buckets.

    Each vertex may be updated and reinserted into a new bucket at most $W$ times (once per possible improvement via edge weights), 
    and each edge is relaxed at most once. Bucket operations (insertion and deletion) are constant-time, but finding the next non-empty 
    bucket may take linear time in the worst case. Over the entire run, the cost of scanning buckets is $O(WV)$, and edge relaxations take $O(E)$.
    Thus, the total runtime is $O(WV + E)$. \\

    The algorithm is correct because it maintains the same invariant as Dijkstra's algorithm: vertices are processed in order of increasing tentative 
    distance, and once a vertex is processed, its distance is finalized due to nonnegative weights. While the priority queue version achieves 
    logarithmic time for \texttt{extract-min}, this bucket-based implementation is more efficient when edge weights are small.

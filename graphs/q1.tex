Suppose that $a[1 \ldots n]$ is an array, where each $a[i]$ is a pair consisting of a key and a value. In CS 10
you studied a data structure called a binary heap, which can be used to store the (key, value) pairs
in the array $a$. As you might recall, the heap data structure enables efficient implementation of the
following operations

\begin{customsolutionbox}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $insert(a, i)$ has $O(\log n)$
        \item $findmin()$: has $O(1)$
        \item $deletemin()$ has $O(\log n)$
        \item $decrease-key(i, k)$ has $O(\log n)$
    \end{itemize}

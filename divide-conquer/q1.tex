\textbf{implementation} \\
We studied in class the $Select(A[1 . . . n], k)$ method, which returns the kth smallest element of an
unsorted array $A[1 . . . n]$ with a time complexity of $O(n)$. As you know, when designing any algorithm,
we typically express the algorithm at a high level (in pseudocode) that conveys all salient points, but
suppresses implementation details. It is important for you to develop the skill and confidence that
you can take things forward from here, i.e., that you can turn the pseudocode description into a full
implementation in a programming language of your choice and run the code. So, I ask you in this
problem to implement the select algorithm in a language of your choice, test it, and turn in your code
and two sample runs.

\textbf{Component Graph} \\
Write an algorithm of $\Theta(n+ m)$ time and space complexity that, given
\begin{itemize}
    \item the adjacency list A of a directed graph $G= (V,E)$ with $V= \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, and
    \item the array S that represents the SCCs of G,
\end{itemize} 
returns the adjacency list of the graph GSCC , which I define below exactly as in class:$G^{SCC} = (V^{SCC} ,E^{SCC})$,
where $V^{SCC} = \{C |C \text{ is an SCC of } G\}$ and $E^{SCC} = \{(C,C') |C  \ne C', \text{and } \exists u \in C,u'  \in C',(u,u') \in E\}$

    \Fn{\FComponentGraph{$A, S$}}{
        Let $n \gets \text{length of } A$ \\
        Let $k \gets 1 + \max(S)$  \\

        Initialize $A^{SCC}[1 \dots k]$ as empty sets

        \For{$u \gets 1$ \KwTo $n$} {
            \ForEach{$v \in A[u]$} {
                \If{$S[u] \ne S[v]$} {
                    Add $S[v]$ to $A^{SCC}[S[u]]$
                }
            }
        }

        \For{$i \gets 1$ \KwTo $k$} {
            Convert $A^{SCC}[i]$ from set to list
        }

        \Return $A^{SCC}$
    }
    \end{algorithm}
    \textbf{Time Complexity:} The algorithm iterates through each vertex $u$ and its adjacency list $A[u]$.
    Since each edge is processed exactly once, the total time complexity is $\Theta(n + m)$, where $n$ is the 
    number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges. The space complexity is also $\Theta(n + m)$ due to the 
    torage of the adjacency list for the component graph. \\
    \textbf{Space Complexity:} The space complexity is $\Theta(n + m)$, as we store the adjacency list for the component graph, which contains at most $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
